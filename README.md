## Sunnyvale Weather

Update (07-03-2023): Moved this site to another repo so I don't have this ugly looking site on my main Github pages site

This is a website I made to display the data from my backyard weather station in a "readable" format. At the very top, current data is displayed, and farther down are the graphs for various variables, such as temperature, wind speed, and rainfall. Also, close to the top the NWS forecast for Sunnyvale is displayed, with the latest radar image and the current watches and warnings issued for the area.

### Bugs / Inconveniences

  * Alerts take a while (around 30 seconds) to display.
  * When the website is viewed on a phone, it looks super ugly.
  * The page must be refreshed to view the latest radar image. Clicking the refresh button in the webpage will not suffice.
  * Only data over the last 24 hours is displayed.
